# Release Notes

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
 * More pedantic formatting in man pages

### Fixed
 * Fixed [#14]: Print useful CMake error when bad ENERGYMON_BUILD_DEFAULT value is set
 * rapl: Powercap directory paths use lower case hex values, not decimal values


## [v0.2.4] - 2018-06-01
### Changed
 * WattsUp implementations:
   * Wait up to 5 seconds for a good data packet (or fail) before completing initialization
   * Purge data buffers during initialization
   * Poll device at shorter intervals to increase energy value accuracy
   * Better handling of incomplete data packets
 * osp-polling: Allow polling thread to be interrupted during sleep when finish is requested
 * energymon-power-poller: Account for true elapsed time to produce more accurate power values

### Fixed
 * wattsup-libftdi, wattsup-libusb: Fix empty reads by always setting baud rate and serial line properties
 * wattsup-dev: Use pselect to avoid timer expired errors
 * odroid, odroid-ioctl, osp-polling, zcu102: Minor correction to polling delay interval
 * msr: Possible (but unlikely) precision computation bug
 * osp, osp-polling: Fix status check during init that didn't always work


## [v0.2.3] - 2017-11-19
### Added
 * Implementation for Xilinx ZCU102 (Jason Miller)

### Fixed
 * Fixed [#40]: Time conversion bug in common function 'energymon_gettime_elapsed_us' (Jason Miller)


## [v0.2.2] - 2017-10-26
### Added
 * New capabilities to some utility applications:
   * energymon-cmd-profile: Accept commands without quotations; add help option
   * energymon-file-provider: Add help, count, interval, and no-rewind options
   * energymon-idle-power: Add help option
 * Man pages for utility applications
 * VERSION and SOVERSION properties on shared object libraries
 * Multiarch support (use GNU standard installation directories)

### Changed
 * Increased minimum CMake version from 2.8 to 2.8.5 to support GNUInstallDirs
 * Refactor this RELEASES.md file

### Removed
 * Removed private symbol exports in shared object libraries (prevents symbol name clashes)

### Fixed
 * Various bug fixes to utility applications


## [v0.2.1] - 2017-10-01
### Added
 * Support for msr-safe kernel module in msr implementation
 * New cray-pm implementations to support capabilities of Cray XC30 and XC40 systems
 * New wattsup-libusb and wattsup-libftdi implementations
 * AppVeyor test configuration for Windows continuous integration

### Changed
 * Faster refresh in osp-polling, odroid and odroid-ioctl implementations
 * Better multi-platform support for some implementations, especially with portable time and sleep abstractions
 * Downgraded required CMake version from 2.8.9 to 2.8
 * Documented FSE 2016 and Technical Report publication information
 * Various enhancements, optimizations, and documentation improvements

### Deprecated
 * Deprecated custom DEFAULT CMake option in favor of ENERGYMON_BUILD_DEFAULT

### Removed
 * Removed Android CMake toolchain file: cmake-toolchain/android.toolchain.cmake

### Fixed
 * Fixed [#37]: In osp implementation, force overflow in ODROID Smart Power at 1000 Wh to avoid device counter saturation at 8192 Wh
 * Fixed [#27]: More modular build process
 * Numerous other bugs

## v0.2.0 - 2016-10-12
### Added
 * Initial public release
